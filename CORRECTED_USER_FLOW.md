## 🛠️ **Required Fixes**

### 1. **PDF Generation Access Control**
```typescript
// Add authentication check to PDF generation endpoint
app.post("/api/generate-pdf", async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const userId = await getUserIdFromRequest(req);
  
  if (!userId) {
    return res.status(401).json({ 
      error: "Authentication required",
      message: "You must create an account to generate PDF reports"
    });
  }
  
  // Check if user has paid for this report
  const hasPaid = await checkPaymentStatus(userId, quizAttemptId);
  if (!hasPaid) {
    return res.status(402).json({ 
      error: "Payment required",
      message: "You must purchase the report to generate PDF"
    });
  }
  
  // Proceed with PDF generation
});
```

### 2. **Frontend Paywall Enforcement**
- Block PDF download buttons for non-authenticated users
- Show clear messaging about account requirement
- Redirect to signup/payment flow

### 3. **Update User Flow Documentation**
