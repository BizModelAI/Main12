## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### **1. Business Fit Descriptions Endpoint (400 Error → ✅ Working)**

- **Problem**: Endpoint was missing from the main routes file
- **Solution**: Added complete `analyze-skills` endpoint to `server/routes.ts`
- **Result**: Now provides skills gap analysis and development recommendations

## 🚀 Technical Implementation

#### **1. `/api/generate-business-fit-descriptions`**
```typescript
// Now accepts:
{
  businessMatches: Array<BusinessMatch>,
  quizData: QuizData
}

// Returns:
{
  descriptions: Array<{
    businessId: string,
    description: string
  }>
}
```

#### **2. `/api/analyze-skills`**
```typescript
// Accepts:
